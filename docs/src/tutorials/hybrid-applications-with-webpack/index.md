# Hybrid Applications with Webpack

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the `rust-webpack-template`
and the `wasm-pack` workflow by building the example app in the template.

This tutorial is aimed at folks who are both beginners to WebAssembly and Rust- you don't need
much Rust knowledge to complete this tutorial.

Be sure to have done the following before starting:

1. [Install `wasm-pack`](../../installer)
1. Read and install the [Prerequisites](../prerequisites/index.html).

    - You'll need [Rust], version 1.30 or higher. (Currently either `beta` or `nightly` channels). [Learn more](../project-setup/rust.html).
    - You'll need [Node.js] and [npm] installed. [Learn more](../project-setup/npm.html).

⚠️ We strongly recommend that you install [Node.js] using a version manager. You can learn more [here](https://npmjs.com/get-npm).
